                <p>“Navigation” is the overall process of finding your way to your objective. This may be hiking along
                    a trail, following signposts at intersections. May involve map and compass, or any other number of
                    techniques.</p>

                <p>“Route finding” is more immediate. It involves reading the terrain, comparing with the map, and
                    determining the best way to travel safely and efficiently.</p>

                <p>“Orientation” is the process of finding your current position on a map. Often, you don’t care about
                    exact location, but general location relative to specific terrain features is enough. Am I on the
                    right ridge? Am I too high, too low, etc.</p>

                <p>“Orienteering” involves locating a specific arbitrary location on a map, then reaching that
                    location. This has become a sport on its own, but may be useful in general to reach a water source,
                    cache, return to your car, etc.</p>

                <p>Everyone needs a map, paper and/or electronic. Everybody has a smartphone, with built-in GPS, so you
                    should have one or more mapping GPS apps available.</p>

                <p>Primary planning tool I use is <a href="http://caltopo.com" target="_blank">caltopo.com</a>. In
                    addition a wide variety of built-in map layers, it has a full set of drawing tools for plotting
                    potential routes, estimating elevation profiles, etc.</p>

                <p>It tends to underreport travel distance, at least compared to the average distance my participants
                    report when tracking our actual route. I’ll often add 10-15% to the distance reported by CalTopo,
                    and still end up a bit short. Actual distance doesn’t matter too much, as long as you can estimate
                    time needed for the route. This sort of estimate just takes practice.</p>

                <p>You can save customized maps, and view public data from other users of the site.</p>

                <p>Plotted data can be downloaded in the common .GPX format, or you can print the map to a geotagged
                    PDF format, which can be imported and used by mapping apps on iPhone or Android devices. In the
                    field, geotagged PDF is a live map, and your position and track will be shown overlaid on top.</p>

                <p>Other sources for GPS tracks include <a href="http://summitpost.org" target="_blank">summitpost.org</a>
                    and <a href="http://peakbagger.com" target="_blank">peakbagger.com</a>; the latter of which has its
                    own app that can show maps and previous climber’s tracks directly.</p>

                <p>Sites like summitpost, nwhikers, or cascadeclimbers are great resources for route descriptions,
                    though the quality can vary. </p>

                <p>Surveyors build topo maps by connecting points of equal elevation. These are projected into a
                    top-down 2D view to become contour lines.</p>

                <p>In general, the steeper terrain shows up as closely-spaced contour lines. Gentler slopes show up as
                    wider-spaced lines.</p>

                <p>Contour lines will not show terrain features smaller than the interval. In this example with lines
                    10 meters apart, between each pair of lines could be anything from a gentle slope to a 19 meter
                    cliff.</p>

                <p>Contour lines also tell you nothing about the composition of the terrain, just changes in elevation.
                    The mountaineer needs to be prepared to encounter thick brush, boulder fields, ice, or other
                    hazards.</p>

                <p>A handrail is a feature that’s easy to identify, easy to follow, and makes it obvious when you’re
                    on- or off-route. Ridges, streams, roads and trails, etc. Common usage is something like, “We’ll
                    stay just to the left of this ridge for the next few hundred yards”</p>

                <p>An attack point is a prominent land feature that’s expected to remain visible for some section of
                    the route. Everyone in the group can see it, identify it, and head for it without hesitation. e.g.,
                    “Head for that big tree on the other side of the boulder field and regroup there”. Typically,
                    routes are broken up into a series of attack points. Head for one, identify the next, repeat.</p>

                <p>A collecting feature is something on or near the route that’s easy to identify when the group draws
                    near. Trail junctions, view points, stream crossings, etc. “Continue up the trail until you break
                    out of the trees.”</p>

                <p>A decision point is simply a collecting feature that prompts a new action from the group. “Turn left
                    at the next trail intersection.”, or “Once we reach the lake, we switch from trail to cross-country
                    travel.”</p>

                <p>A catching feature is something that tells you you’ve overshot your goal or are otherwise off route.
                    “A boot path should be coming up on the left. If we cross another stream, we’ve missed it.”</p>

                <p>The SE approach to Cashmere Mountain illustrates many of the terrain-based navigation concepts.</p>

                <p>After an initial short hike along a trail to an intersection with an abandoned road (decision
                    point), climb steeply up a loose dirt slope some 1500 feet until it levels and meets a boulder
                    field.</p>

                <p>The boulder field continues for nearly a mile and a half. There’s no one right way to traverse, just
                    cross using a series of attack points to periodically regroup, and let individuals find their own
                    routes based on comfort level.</p>

                <p>Cliffs above the boulder field serve as handrail, preventing the group from climbing too high too
                    soon.</p>

                <p>Cashmere Dagger serves as an obvious catching feature marking transition between boulders and summit
                    scramble. As long as you don’t ascend a gully before reaching it, it’s impossible to miss before
                    arriving at the correct location.</p>

                <p>Distance covered and time traveled can vary greatly based on terrain and group composition. On
                    trail, average pace can be 2mph or more; off-trail scrambles, deep snow, etc. will slow that
                    dramatically. You still may be able to get a sense if you’re off-track if you haven’t reached a
                    known feature by a certain time.</p>

                <p>If you’re trying to reach a specific destination, aim for a catching feature or handrail, and let
                    that guide to you it, rather than heading directly and risking the chance of missing it completely.
                    e.g., if you’re traveling cross-country to reach your car parked at a bend in the road, aim for the
                    road well before the bend.</p>

                <p>Original plan for this portion of the trip was to visit Hard Cheese, Hard Knox, and maybe continue
                    on to Thorp Mountain.</p>

                <p>Hiking through the fresh snow up the switchbacks from the south, somewhere along the long switchback
                    to the west, instruction to fastest group members was to stop after the trail bends right, and then
                    switches back left again. Decision point here - regroup and see if direct ascent up the ridge was
                    possible. It was. Followed the ridge (handrail) to the summit.</p>

                <p>On north side of Cheese, continue on the ridge until we cross trail (collecting feature) on the
                    flats. Continue on ridge following trail towards Hard Knox.</p>

                <p>Per the map, the trail continues north to Thorp, but over steep slope, and seems to disappear under
                    slippery packed snow. Trail here really not apparent as it disappears over the steep crest of the
                    ridge, so we continue directly up the ridge to the summit of Hard Knox.</p>

                <p>As bonus, we follow the contours of the bowl to the west, to visit Not Knox, then down the most
                    mellow-looking slopes to the south/southeast into the valley.</p>

                <p>On the return trip down through valley between Knox and Cheese. Traversed south, as level as
                    possible along the slopes of Hard Cheese, to pick up the road spur and make sure we don’t miss the
                    corner and wind up too far down the hill. Bearing off. </p>

                <p>Sometimes you only need to know general direction of travel, North- South-ish, Northwest, etc.</p>

                <p>Quick glance at a button compass, estimate based on position of the sun, or judge against known
                    feature. e.g., for a hike around Snoqualmie Pass, Mt Rainier is a little bit west of south</p>

                <p>Measure your hands, and use an online angular size calculator to calibrate yourself</p>

                <p>You can generally rely on a topographic map to be accurate in terms of land features, though small
                    features may not be represented. Small feature in map terms may be a 60+ foot cliff, which can be a
                    serious obstacle on a human scale.</p>

                <p>Depending on the map source, trail information may be accurate, or just a representation of the
                    route. USGS/USFS and guidebook maps tend to use artistic representations of trails, so the actual
                    locations may be many dozens of feet off.</p>

                <p>MapBuilder trail information tends to be more recent, and generated from actual GPS tracks, so can
                    be more accurate.</p>

                <p>Downloaded GPS tracks can be generated in several ways. They can be from actual in-the-field track
                    logs, hand-edited, or simple plotted estimates. These methods affect accuracy.</p>

                <p>Seasonal changes affect the accuracy and suitability of route information. A GPS track logged by a
                    skier in the dead of winter will likely not be very helpful to a hiker in the dry summer months.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, there’s always some level of uncertainty that you need to deal with out in the field.
                    Use maps and plotted routes as a guide, not necessarily a strict course to follow.</p>

                <p>Use periodic checks against your plotted route. Is the group on course, too high, too low? Don’t
                    worry about following the track exactly.</p>

                <p>When faced with a bushwhack or scramble, there’s usually a way that’s more obvious or easy than
                    others. It may be where vegetation is the thinnest, where rock steps are most prominent, whatever.
                    Navigating through unknown terrain is often broken down into a series of these mini-obstacles. In
                    some situations it may involve trial-and-error, as a likely path through thick brush may dead-end.</p>

                <p>As you navigate a series of obstacles in this manner, look up from time to time. Check your
                    handrails or attack points to verify you’re still on course. Very common to wander when scrambling
                    off trail, through a boulder field, etc.</p>

                <p>Where appropriate within a group, take turns leading to help others develop navigation skill. Trip
                    leader should lay out objectives and give general instructions (macro navigation), but let others
                    figure out and guide group through specific obstacles.</p>

                <p>As a group participant, don’t just follow along. Practice paying attention to your surroundings.
                    Look back often, especially at intersections or other decision points. If something happened to the
                    group, would you be able to find your way out?</p>

                <p>This trail map was generated via live GPS tracks - the map maker physically traveled on each of
                    these trails, so it is (or at least was) an accurate representation of the region.</p>

                <p>But things change…</p>

                <p>At the north central part of the map, the lingering loop was blocked, and replaced by a meandering
                    trail that enters the forest, nearly returns to the power line trail, then heads south yet again.
                    Seemingly for no reason than to tack on an extra half mile.</p>

                <p>The main Tiger Mountain Trail was partially rerouted below West Tiger 2 to avoid a landslide several
                    years ago.</p>

                <p>We were surprised this past weekend that another section of the TmT was rerouted to avoid a wet,
                    overgrown valley - brand new intersection and portion of trail that didn’t exist a year ago.</p>

                <p>Some of the trails between South, Middle, and East Tiger Mountains have been blocked by active
                    logging.</p>

                <p>Several new mountain biking trails have been built in the southeast portion of the forest, near East
                    Tiger.</p>

                <p>The official Red Mountain trail from the Cooper Lake road is quite primitive and overgrown in spots.
                    It climbs up the east side, up to the saddle south of the northern peak, then down the other side
                    to Little Joe Lake.</p>

                <p>On the route up, trail kept disappearing, requiring searching to pick it up again. In the photo
                    here, we’re on trail or close to it, but trail vanishes just before the rocks start. Some searching
                    required to spot the trail continuing up to the left. Similar problem in a frosty meadow a bit
                    before.</p>

                <p>There’s also a side trail more obviously flagged than the main trail, but dead ends at a mining
                    prospect to lead hikers astray.</p>

                <p>On the way back from south peak, rather than climb back up and over middle peak, we decided to
                    bushwhack along flat, to rejoin the trail as it switchbacked down to the west side to the lake.
                    According to the map and our GPS location, we’d traveled well past the trail and should have been
                    between switchbacks. We estimated the rough bearing up to the saddle and headed in that direction,
                    and found the actual trail was several hundred feet farther on. </p>

                <p>Lesson: Can’t trust maps 100%</p>

                <p>By using navigational techniques, it’s unlikely to become truly lost. Between terrain features, GPS,
                    and map and compass, you should at least have a general idea of the group’s location, if not the
                    specific position.</p>

                <p>If you find yourself in a situation where it’s not apparent which direction to travel, stop and
                    reassess. </p>

                <p>On a similar note, if you find a trail, take a moment to think about which direction you should go
                    instead of just forging ahead. Use position of sun and/or compass direction and ask yourself if the
                    direction the trail is heading makes sense.</p>

                <p>One of the first times I hiked Tiger Mountain, I was without a map, but felt confident since each
                    intersection was well-signed. I parked at the main lot for West Tiger 3, hiked the main trail, and
                    continued on to West Tiger 2. I explored the summit and came down the trail on the north side. At a
                    T intersection, a sign presented me with two choices “Tradition Lake” and “Issaquah Hobart Road”.
                    Not knowing the first option was the actual name of the TH where I parked, I said to myself, “I
                    don’t want either of those.” However, I was pretty sure Issaquah Hobart Road was way off in the
                    wrong direction so chose the other path.</p>

                <p>It’s much more likely that the group will become separated, hopefully only intentionally, and
                    hopefully only for a short duration. If it’s critical for a specific group and/or event, there may
                    be a strict “the group sticks together” policy. Though that can quickly lead to frustration among
                    group members.</p>

                <p>Much better to have an explicit plan to regroup, and stick to it. This is a very hard lesson to
                    learn.</p>

                <p>For instance, on Hard Knox, for the return trip on road, folks out in front of group missed turn
                    onto return trail - person with the map was navigating from middle of group.</p>

                <p>Lesson: If you’re out in front of the group, make sure you know the route.</p>

                <p>Group decided to leave the trail and bushwhack, short-cutting a very long series of switchbacks.</p>

                <p>At one point, group headed right, while one remained behind (gear adjustment, bio break). </p>

                <p>Rather than follow group, individual decided to head up more directly, expecting group to curve back
                    left and meet up further on.</p>

                <p>Group continued right. Individual could hear group shouting in the distance, but single voice was
                    unable to be heard by the group.</p>

                <p>Individual stayed left, continued up until hitting the trail again.</p>

                <p>Lesson: If you don’t have explicit plan for regrouping, don’t split up the group.</p>

                <p>First few to head down said they’d hike slow and allow the rest of group to catch up.</p>

                <p>The group leader agreed, but didn’t provide explicit instructions where/when to stop and wait. Just
                    assumed the natural thing to do would be to stop when the boot path ended at the main trail to the
                    falls.</p>

                <p>The group leader ended up helping slowest hikers at tail of the group down, since they were
                    uncomfortable with slippery winter conditions.</p>

                <p>Lead group didn’t wait, continued down the main trail, completely ignoring the obscure side trail we
                    had used on the way in. Lead group continued down main trail all the way to the incorrect
                    trailhead.</p>

                    up.</p>
